  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: June 14, 2025</p>

  <p>At <strong>ApnaDr</strong>, we are committed to providing a smooth and transparent experience for patients booking appointments. Please read our refund policy carefully before using our platform.</p>

  <h2>1. No Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>Once an appointment is booked and the payment is completed, the fee is <strong>non-refundable</strong>, even if you are unable to attend the appointment or cancel it later. This policy is in place to maintain fairness to doctors and ensure service continuity.</p>

  <h2>2. Missed Appointments</h2>
  <p>If you miss your scheduled appointment or fail to appear at the designated time, no refund will be issued. We advise users to arrive on time and verify their availability before booking.</p>

  <h2>3. Doctor Cancellations</h2>
  <p>If a doctor cancels or is unavailable at the scheduled time, we will make every effort to reschedule your appointment. If rescheduling is not possible, a full refund may be issued at our discretion.</p>

  <h2>4. Technical Issues</h2>
  <p>In rare cases where payment is deducted but the booking does not confirm, please contact our support team within 24 hours. If verified, we will refund the full amount to the original payment method.</p>
